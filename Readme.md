## This repository contains scripts to analyze Drosophila RNA-decay data 
To study the rate of RNA decay in Drosophila RNA have been
sampled in a time series and a BRIC approach was used to track degradation of RNA.


## Data 

The data consist of seven time points...

## Goal
To generate a set of functions in R that can be used to estimate half-life of RNA molecules.
